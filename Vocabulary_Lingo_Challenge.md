1. Explain the added value of using DataBricks in your Data Science process

Some of the value of using databriks in my process is because of the the ability is has to handle and work with large datasets. Using personal computers do work with large datasets is posible but could take a long time to run through the dataset. And buiding a new computer to handle such large data can be very costly. However, using a system like databricks allows for a user to connect to a server, for a price, and run your data analysis faster.

2. Compare and contrast PySpark to either Pandas or the Tidyverse

PySpark is able to run data much faster than Pandas or Tidyberse. While pandas runs opperations on just one machine Pyspark is able to run on multiple machines. This is noticalbe when running machine learning. Pandas Usually takes a lot of time to run while Pyspark can run the same code in only a few seconds. Also Pyspark can work with Pyspark SQL which is a commonly known query language. 

3. Explain Docker to somebody intelligent but not a tech person

Docker is a great way run a program without having to worry about dependancies on outside programs that need to be imported/downloaded to run. When someone creates a docker container and shares it with someone else the docker container already has has the dictionairs and code that is required to run that program.

A great example of this is when you develop a web app you could give someone the code and have them run it themselves with the posibiltiy that they would need to download or change to an eearlier version of a program, or you could create a docker container and not have to worry about those errors that could occure.
